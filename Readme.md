Unidirectional Flow Architecture
================================
*From Swift to JS and Back Again*

This repo contains the source code that I use during my "Unidirectional Flow Architecture" talk.
It is optimized for using live on stage during a talk, not necessarily for "cleanness". This
also explains why there are no unit tests, which I would normally include.

A [PDF export of the slides][9] is stored in this repository.

- [ReRxSwift][1] is the bindings layer for [RxSwift][3] and [ReSwift][4], similar to
  [React Redux][5] for [React][6] and [Redux][7].
- [Cogito][2] is our open source Digital Identity system. The iOS app that's in there is written
  using this architecture pattern.
- [Redux. From twitter hype to production][8] is a presentation about this architecture concept
  that has some nice animations to illustrate it.
