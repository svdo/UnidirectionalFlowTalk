Unidirectional Flow Architecture
================================
*From Swift to JS and Back Again*

This repo contains the source code that I use during my "Unidirectional Flow Architecture" talk.
It is optimized for using live on stage during a talk, not necessarily for "cleanness". This
also explains why there are no unit tests, which I would normally include.
